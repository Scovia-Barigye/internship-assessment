# ⚖️ Legal Literacy Bridge

**Legal Literacy Bridge** is a premium AI-powered application designed to break down legal barriers for Ugandan citizens. The app transforms complex legal jargon—whether provided as text or via voice recordings—into simplified, understandable summaries in local Ugandan languages.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Multimodal Input**: Accept typed legal text or high-capacity audio recordings.
- **Advanced Audio Processing**: Automatic voice normalization and high-pass filtering to clean up noisy recordings.
- **Audio Constraint**: Enforces a strict 5-minute limit on audio uploads with clear error feedback.
- **Local Language Support**: Accurate translations into Luganda, Runyankole, Ateso, Lugbara, and Acholi.
- **Premium UI**: A law-firm inspired dark mode interface with real-time progress tracking.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular 4-Phase pipeline:

1.  **Input Phase**: User provides text or uploads an audio file (up to 500MB).
2.  **Phase 1 — Transcription (STT)**: 
    - Audio is pre-processed for clarity.
    - Large files are split into 10-minute chunks.
    - **Endpoint**: Sunbird AI `/tasks/stt`
3.  **Phase 2 — Simplification (LLM)**: 
    - The legal text is analyzed and converted into "Plain English."
    - **Endpoint**: Sunbird AI `/tasks/sunflower_inference`
4.  **Phase 3 — Translation (LLM)**: 
    - The simplified summary is translated into the selected local language.
    - **Endpoint**: Sunbird AI `/tasks/sunflower_inference`
5.  **Phase 4 — Narration (TTS)**: 
    - The translation is converted back into speech for accessibility.
    - **Endpoint**: Sunbird AI `/tasks/tts`
6.  **Output Phase**: All intermediate results are displayed in expander cards for full transparency.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
- **Background Noise**: While the app includes cleaning filters, extreme background music or very low-quality microphones may still impact STT accuracy.
- **5-Minute Audio Cap**: In accordance with the assessment requirements, audio files are strictly limited to 5 minutes.
- **Character Limit**: Simplification is optimized for texts under 4,000 characters to ensure the best LLM response quality.
